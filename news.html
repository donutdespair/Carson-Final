<h2>NEWS</h2><br>
<div><h3>We’re Hiring!</h3>
<h4>09.14.16</h4>
<p>So far in 2016 Unbearable Games released six indie games in the span of eight months. We also kept growing our thriving virtual fan community, moved into a new studio space in DUMBO, and began exploring mobile development. 
<br><br>
As we plan ahead for 2016 and beyond, we are looking to grow our team. We’re planning to build out our existing core teams and expand to new areas.
<br><br>
Have a look at our hiring page to see which opportunity is right for you. If you decide to apply, you’ll be joining a unique organization, with a collaborative approach to building beautiful and intriguing products.

<div><h3>Take to the streets on on October 1st!</h3>
<h4>08.29.16</h4>
<p>It’s almost time! In a little over a month Velo-City is coming to a computer near you. In this exciting new game, you will play as a bike messenger battling your way through New New York in 2099. It's a lot like being a bike messenger today, except you’ll be battling mutants and exploring the future! This game will be dangerous, grimey, low-paying, and with even more opportunities for bike justice! 
<br><br>
Velo-City is the ultimate RPG experience. Not only is the landscape breathtakingly decrepit, but we’ve created a dramatic profile for New New York: glaring lights, creepy allies, and even a cameo by pizza rat. Vehicles break down, parts fall off, and customers explode in exciting new ways!
